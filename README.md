# Cluster-Analysis-R
In this project, we implement both K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. We 
use a simplified data set on shoppers’ store visit and spending information. The data set
contains 100 shoppers’ visit and spending records for a department store. For the ease of
visualization, we only focus on two key variables: (i) each shopper’s average number of
store visits per quarter, and (ii) each shopper’s average amount of spending per quarter. Similar
analysis can be naturally extended to include additional variables if needed in practice. Below
are the data description and a scatter plot of all data points.
